<p>Warm yourself by the fire, son<br>

    <h2>Who are refugees?!</h2>
 song   <ul>
      <li>A refugee is someone who has been forced to flee his or her country because of persecution, war, or violence</li>
      <li> A refugee has a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group. </li>
      <li>.</li>
      Most likely, they cannot return home or are afraid to do so. War and ethnic, tribal and religious violence are leading causes of refugees fleeing their countries.
